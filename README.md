# Solid Stream Aggregator

`The aggregator is in active continuous development and will be changed frequently.`

The Solid Stream Aggregator provides an aggregated view over streaming data stored in single or multiple solid pods.
The Solid Stream Aggregator aggregates and stores the view in a solid pod and therefore reduces the overhead of querying multiple solid pods to build the specific view.
The aggregated view is beneficial for applications such as for continuous monitoring.

## Usage

### Installation

- npm install
```
